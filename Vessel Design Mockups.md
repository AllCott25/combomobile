## Implementation Notes

These ASCII representations are simplified versions of the actual designs. The final implementations would be more detailed and visually appealing, with proper shading, texture, and perspective.

For the game implementation:
- Each vessel would maintain the same hitbox/collision area
- Text would be displayed in the center of each vessel
- All vessels would use the appropriate color based on their function (white for base ingredients, yellow for partial combinations, green for complete combinations)
- Animations would include subtle movements like gentle bobbing or slight rotation
