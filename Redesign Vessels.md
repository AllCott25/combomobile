## Implementation Notes

Each vessel design should:
- Maintain the same hitbox/collision area for gameplay consistency
- Include subtle animations (gentle bobbing, slight rotation)
- Have a consistent text display area
- Include a satisfying transformation animation when changing states

The vessel designs should be implemented as SVG or PNG assets that can be loaded into the game, with appropriate scaling for different screen sizes.
